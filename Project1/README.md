Setup: 

	How to connect this program to a Discord Bot

		1) To get a Discord token, you need to construct and name a bot on your profile, and apply the permissions needed for your desired bot.

		2) After construction of the bot, select the "Bot" tab and press the copy button.

		3) Make a file labelled .env and write "DISCORD_TOKEN=" and paste in the copied token from step 2. Omit the quotation marks.

		4) Copy whatever server name you wish for this bot to go into 

		5) In your .env file write "DISCORD_GUILD=" and paste the server name(s) behind it. Omit the quotations.

		6) The command to start the bot is "python3 bot.py"


Usage:

	My edits to this bot is to reply whenever a person says "Planeswalk!" in a chat, the bot will tell them where they are going to from a 

	myriad of planes from Magic: The Gathering. The bot is fairly simple, so minimal permissions are needed. All it needs to work is the ability to see and write messages. 

	No @everyone needed. The response is going to always start with "Congratulations! You are now planeswalking to" and the name of the Plane follows. 

	
Research:

	In relation to my discord bot, i can think of a few solutions, like leaving your computer on and running the bot ad infinitum, but renting a server out is probably more efficient.
